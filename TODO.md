# 3D Cricket Intro Animation - Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Dependencies
- [ ] Install Three.js and React Three Fiber dependencies
- [ ] Install animation and physics libraries
- [ ] Set up project structure

## Phase 2: Core 3D Components
- [ ] Create main CricketScene component with Three.js setup
- [ ] Build 3D Batsman model with realistic proportions
- [ ] Create Cricket Bat with English willow textures
- [ ] Implement Cricket Ball with physics and spinning
- [ ] Build Stadium environment with evening lighting

## Phase 3: Animation System
- [ ] Implement dynamic camera controller with cinematic movements
- [ ] Create animation timeline (8-12 seconds)
- [ ] Add physics simulation for ball trajectory and bat collision
- [ ] Build text reveal animation for "Tanish Creates"

## Phase 4: Visual Effects & Lighting
- [ ] Setup evening/sunset lighting with warm tones
- [ ] Add stadium spotlights and shadows
- [ ] Implement camera shake effects on ball impact
- [ ] Add motion blur for high-speed ball movement

## Phase 5: Video Generation Integration
- [ ] Create video generation API using Replicate (veo-3 model)
- [ ] Build video generation UI with progress tracking
- [ ] Implement video status checking and download features

## Phase 6: User Interface
- [ ] Create main landing page with animation viewer
- [ ] Build video generator interface
- [ ] Add loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] Implement navigation and responsive design

## Phase 7: Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Phase 8: Testing & Optimization
- [ ] Test real-time 3D animation performance
- [ ] Validate video generation API endpoints with curl
- [ ] Test cross-device compatibility
- [ ] Optimize loading times and memory usage

## Phase 9: Final Deployment
- [ ] Build and test production version
- [ ] Validate all features working correctly
- [ ] Generate sample cricket intro video
- [ ] Final preview and demonstration
